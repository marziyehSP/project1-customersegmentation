# project1-customersegmentation
In this project, I implemented customer segmentation using the K-means clustering model and K-means clustering with PCA. 

## Approach

- Initially, I performed customer segmentation using the original features and the K-means algorithm. However, the results did not yield satisfactory clusters,then I applied K-means clustering with PCA. This approach proved to be more effective in achieving meaningful customer segmentation.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project . It consists of approximately 200000 records of bank transactions  with the following features:
TransactionID,CustomerID,CustomerDOB,CustGender,CustLocation,CustAccountBalance,TransactionDate,TransactionTime,TransactionAmount

## Results

- The K-means clustering with PCA resulted in improved segmentation, allowing for a better understanding of customer groups based on their similarities.
